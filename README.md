床屋予約システム



## Motivation

The barbershop I often visited only accepts reservations via phone call. There're only 2 seats available and when you remember to make a reservation, the earliest time slot would be a month later. Additionally, 日本語で電話するのは少し不安です。

So I'm trying to build a web reservation platform that allows guests to check for available time slots anytime, make reservations, and ease the workload for the shop owner.
